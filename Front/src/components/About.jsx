            <br />
            <p>I never was the best student in my time in school, Im just a curious guy who want to enter in new adventures
                and evolve my knowledge more and more every day!
                I started coding when I was 10 years old when I lived in the USA for 1 year.
                During this time in the USA I become almost fluent inglish speaker and learned soo much about coding.
                Since then I never stopped studying and working hard to evolve my knowledge and experience to reach my goal to become a successful Software Engineer.
                In december/2020 I started working as a freelancer because my town don't have any jobs at the time.
                But in september/2021 I have the opportunity to work with a great company called Genesys Software as a Full Stack Software Engineer.
                january/2022 I started my distance college studies in Software Engineering in the Anhanguera College of SÃ£o Paulo.
